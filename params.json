Based on [this blog post](https://blog.neverthesamecolor.net/how-to-recover-disk-space-from-xcode/).\r\n\r\n# Synopis\r\n\r\n```\r\nxcclean [derived_data|device_support|archives|simulators|documentation] [show|delete|delete_all]\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\n`xcclean` displays disk usage for various sets of data Xcode accumulates over time. This data can be deleted by `xcclean` as well.\r\n\r\n## Installing xcclean\r\n\r\nJust `brew tap saschaholesch/homebrew-ntsc` and then `brew install xcclean`.\r\n\r\nIf the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install saschaholesch/homebrew-ntsc/xcclean`.\r\n\r\nYou can also install via URL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbrew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saschaholesch/homebrew-ntsc/master/xcclean.rb\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n`derived_data`\r\n\r\nData about projects which includes index, build output and logs. \r\n\r\n`device_support`\r\n\r\nInformation about devices that have been used for development. Will be recreated by Xcode when a device is attached.\r\n\r\n`archives`\r\n\r\nArchives of release builds. Should be treated with care to not delete archives for which the dSYM data for debugging is still needed.\r\n\r\n`simulators`\r\n\r\nSimulators are stored in different folders per device and iOS version.\r\n\r\n`documentation`\r\n\r\nDocSets downloaded by Xcode.\r\n\r\n### Available Actions\r\n\r\n`show`\r\n\r\nDisplays a list of folders with their disk usage prefixed. Will contain additional detail information for the cases of `device_support` and `simulators` to make identification of the data easier.\r\n\r\n`delete`\r\n\r\nDeletes the specified directory. Expects to be followed by the directory name displayed in the second column of the `show` command.\r\n\r\n`delete_all`\r\n\r\nDeletes **all** directories for specified option.\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\nShow all directories containing derived data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nxcclean derived_data show\r\n```\r\n\r\nDelete a specific derived data directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\nxcclean derived_data delete 0359B714-8C54-4A9B-8EDE-1D6ACB686B59\r\n```\r\n\r\nDelete all derived data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nxcclean derived_data delete_all\r\n```\r\n\r\n# About\r\n\r\n* Author: Sascha M Holesch <[https://github.com/hectique]()>\r\n* Issue tracker: This project's source code and issue tracker can be found at [https://github.com/hectique/xcclean]()\r\n",
